      <h4> Getting Started<a name="1">&nbsp;</a></h4>
  <p>We’ve all visited pages before where their “convenient” 
        link page is more like a link graveyard. Not only does this waste some 
        of the precious time we’ve invested into that website, we also begin 
        to suspect that the information on the whole website is faulty. Chances 
        are, we’ll move along.</p>
      <p>DMXReady’s Links Manager makes the process of keeping your link 
        page updated easy. Rather than change and upload an entire page, your 
        clients can quickly update each link in real time on their Admin page, 
        accessed through any standard browser. As soon as a dead or moved link 
        is discovered, it can be removed or changed. And adding new links is a 
        snap too.</p>
      <p>Combine with DMXReady’s Contact Us Manager, and your client’s 
        visitors will be able to send dead link information immediately for even 
        faster updating.</p>
      <p>Your client wants a professional site – that’s why they came 
        to you. Don’t risk tarnishing that image with dead links!<br>
      </p>

              Designer's Tip:<strong> </strong></font><strong>Determine the chain 
              of links...</strong></p>
<p>For those with a large number of links, you may want to do a bit 
              of planning ahead of time. Break down the links into separate categories, 
              or at least identify what those categories will be. Although DMXReady's 
              Links Manager is easy to use, pre-planning will make using this 
tool even easier!</p>

      <h4>Creating A Links Page with DMXReady Links Manager<a name="2">&nbsp;</a></h4>
  <h4>Add New Category<a name="2a" id="2a">&nbsp;</a></h4>
      <p>When you first install DMXReady Links Manager into your website, 
        you will note a sample database that you may experiment with. Once you 
        are ready to start your own Links page, you can delete these entries as 
        shown <a href="#3b">below</a>.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Login to your admin area through by clicking on the admin login link: <u>http://www.yourdomain.com/linksmanager/</u> 
          Once logged in, you will see yyour admin actions (add, edit, delete).</li>
        <li>Click on <strong>Insert New.</strong></li>
        <li>Click on <strong>Add/Edit New Category.</strong></li>
        <li>A pop-up box will appear. In the text box next to Add New Category, 
          type the name of your first category and click on <strong>Insert New.</strong></li>
        <li>The pop-up window disappears and you are back to the Links 
          creation page. Repeat the above process until all your categories are 
          included.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Edit Category<a name="2b" id="2b">&nbsp;</a></h4>
      <p>Once you have designated a category, it can be easily changed, replaced, 
        or deleted. This can be done at anytime during creation or administration 
        of the website; all changes made to category names will be automatically 
        updated throughout the Links.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>In the Links creation page, click on<strong> Add/Edit New Category.</strong></li>
        <li>When the pop-up window appears, select the category you wish to change. 
          Once you've made the changes, click on <strong>Update</strong>.</li>
        <li>To delete the category altogether, click on <strong>Delete</strong>.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Insert New Link<a name="2c" id="2c">&nbsp;</a></h4>
      <p>Once you have created your categories, you are ready to add all current 
        Links. (Don’t worry if you think of another category during this 
        process, just click on <strong>Add/Edit Category</strong> again and you 
        can immediately insert it.)</p>
      <ol>
        <li>On the Insert New Item page, use the pull-down menu to select the 
          category you want to enter the document under (if applicable).</li>
        <li>In the corresponding text boxes, type the link name, description, 
          and URL.</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Publish to Links Listing Page</strong>. The event information 
          will automatically be uploaded to your server.</li>
        <li>Repeat this process until all current events are inserted into your 
          Links.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Editing a Link<a name="3a" id="3a">&nbsp;</a></h4>
      <ol>
        <li>To change a link name, description, or URL, go to the Show All page 
          (the first page that appears when you enter the admin page).</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Edit</strong> next to the Links that you wish to change. 
          All the document's information will appear just as you have entered 
          it. Make the required changes and click<strong> Publish to Links Listing 
          Page</strong>.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Deleting a Link<a name="3b" id="3b">&nbsp;</a></h4>
      <ol>
        <li>To delete a Link, go to the Show All page (the first page that appears 
          when you enter the admin page).</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Delete</strong> next to the Links that you wish to remove. 
          All information will be immediately removed from the server.</li>
      </ol>

              Designer's Tip:<strong> </strong></font><strong>To Avoid Losing 
              Links Information Altogether...</strong></p>
<p>If it is at all possible that you may want to reuse the Link again 
              in the future, but you do not want that particular Link on the website 
              at the moment, you may find it better to simply deactivate the Link 
              by clicking off the 'Activate' checkbox in the editing page. The 
              Link will no longer appear to visitors of your page, but the information 
              will still be available for you to change or activate as you need 
in the future.</p>
